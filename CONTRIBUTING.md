## Contributing

### Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/babel/minify babel-minify
cd babel-minify
```

### Install

```sh
yarn bootstrap
```

#### Build

To build **once**:

```sh
yarn build
```

Or to do an incremental build in watch mode:

```sh
yarn watch
```

#### Lint

This project uses [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting code and [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) for other linting.

To check both:

```sh
yarn lint
```

You can also run them each individually:

 ```sh
# prettier
yarn format-check

# eslint
yarn eslint
```

##### Lint Fix

To fix formatting and auto-fixable eslint errors,

```sh
yarn fix
```

You can also run them each individually:

```sh
# prettier
yarn format

# eslint
npm run eslint-fix
```

#### Test

To run all tests,

```sh
yarn test
```

To run tests for a specific package,

```sh
yarn test packages/babel-preset-minify
```

#### Smoke Tests

Prepare:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Run:

```sh
node smoke/run.js [options] [inputTests...]
```

Usage:

```
Usage: run [options] [inputTests...]

  Options:

    -h, --help         output usage information
    -i --skip-install  Skip Install Step
    -b --skip-build    Skip Build step
    -c --skip-cleanup  Skip cleanup step
    -q --quiet         Quiet mode
```

Example:

To build and test `lodash`,

```sh
node smoke/run.js lodash
```

To run smoke test without re-building and re-installing again

```sh
node smoke/run.js -ib lodash
```

#### Benchmarks

[benchmark.js](https://github.com/babel/minify/blob/master/scripts/benchmark.js) compares BabelMinify with [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) and [Closure Compiler JS](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-js)

```sh
./scripts/benchmark.js [file...]
```

[plugin-timing.js](https://github.com/babel/minify/blob/master/scripts/plugin-timing.js) is used to calculate and compare the time spent in each plugin.

```sh
./scripts/plugin-timing.js file.js
```

[plugin-contribution.js](https://github.com/babel/minify/blob/master/scripts/plugin-contribution.js) calculates how much each plugin of babel-minify contributes to size reduction.

```sh
./scripts/plugin-contribution.js file.js
```

### Debugging

In your project, if you find that there is a bug that appears ONLY when you use BabelMinify, it's most likely that there is a bug in BabelMinify and you should definitely report it. Here are some guidelines that might help you drill down the issue. If it doesn't help you, you can of course create a minimal repro project with the bug and report it.

#### Compile time Errors

If you get a syntax error at compile time, then it could be a few things:

1. The parser itself doesn't handle the syntax being used (a [babylon](https://github.com/babel/babylon) bug).
2. The code is actually invalid syntax.
3. You didn't turn on the relevant Babel plugin for that syntax (if experimental).

If the syntax error occurs at runtime,  it likely means the code generator ([babel-generator](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-generator)) has a bug and has output invalid code.

#### Runtime errors

When you run your minified code in the browser,

1. If there is an error in the console, as a first step, look around the code block where the error happens, and the code block of a few steps up in the stack.
2. Try to predict what caused the error and try relating it to some of the plugin names in the [packages/](https://github.com/babel/minify/tree/master/packages) directory. The major ones (that do a lot of transformations) are - mangle, deadcode-elimination and simplify.
3. Every plugin that Babel-Minify uses has an option in preset to toggle it on/off - [preset-options](https://github.com/babel/minify/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-minify#options)
4. Disable any transformation(s) that you suspect are causing problems. Turning OFF mangling (`mangle: false`) is a good practice if you don't think it's related to a mangling bug, since unmangled variable names will make debugging easier.
5. Sometimes it might NOT be a bug with one plugin but a combination of plugins. Again, `deadcode-elimination` and `simplify` maybe good candidates to start with here as they perform many transformations.
6. Sometimes it might because of the [unsafe transformations](https://github.com/babel/minify/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-minify#option-groups). Some of them are grouped into a single option named `unsafe`. This option can help you identify it sooner if the bug is in one these plugins.
7. Produce a minimal repro of the same issue - the function block containing the bug should be enough to help reproduce the bug.
8. [Report it ðŸ™‚](https://github.com/babel/minify/issues/new)
9. You're awesome. Thanks!

### Releasing

> If you are releasing a new package, you'll want to run `./scripts/npm-owner-update.sh` to add all owners to the new npm package after releasing. Or do it manually via `https://www.npmjs.com/package/package-name-here/access`.

If you need to update deps run `npm run clean` and then `npm run bootstrap`.

To get the changelog, run `npm run changelog` to print to the terminal.

Use `npm run publish`. It will run `lerna publish` (we use `--independent`) so it will prompt the version number for every package.
