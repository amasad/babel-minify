## Contributing

### Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/babel/babili
$ cd babili
$ npm install
$ npm run bootstrap
```

Then you can either run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

to build Babel **once** or:

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

to have Babel build itself then incrementally build files on change.

To run tests:
```sh
$ npm test
```
